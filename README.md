## Pre-Project Thoughts

1. I had previously skipped this project because I was waiting for a pair, but I have decided to go ahead and do it. Some of the material and syntax feels hazy to me, but I strongly remember the concepts. I will probably rely on reference material before I become fully confident.

2. I will do the projects in these steps:
	
	1. Create the View/Spacing

	2. Figure out the timer and button functionalities

## Post-Project Thoughts

This project is currently incomplete.
